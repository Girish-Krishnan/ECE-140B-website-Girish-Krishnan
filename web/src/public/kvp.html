      <div class='separator'>Our promise of what we'll deliver to our customers.</div>
     
      <p> CarProtect will deliver a cost-effective and reliable car security system to prevent the pain of car break-ins and the theft of valuable items from one's car. Here is what we guarantee to deliver to the customer:</p>

      <ol>
          <li>Convenience and peace of mind during installation: We want to ensure that the customer doesn't go through the hassle of cryptic installation instructions. Even better, we do not charge anything for installation. To start the device, you just need to scan a QR code to setup the app and then stick the device on to your car.</li>
          <li>Flexibility with cost and use: we want to ensure that you can use CarProtect for any car you'd like. CarProtect is specially configured for people who often rent cars, as the same security system can easily be transferred from one car to another without having to install another security system. Once again, you only need to pay about $20 for the device.</li>
          <li>No Interference: the security of your car will never interfere with your driving experience. CarProtect does not drain your car's battery, nor does it need to be plugged in. Its battery only needs to be recharged every few months.</li>
          <li>Simplicity: easy to setup and easy to maintain. You won't have to worry about annoying wires, plugins and other maintenance.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <div class='separator'>The benefits that our customers will reap</div>

        <p> The benefits that our customers will reap from CarProtect are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Immediate car theft alerts - to capture every intruder and have solid evidence for police investigations.</li>
            <li>A greatly reduced risk of thieves smashing your window to steal valuable items - as CarProtect deters potential intruders who come nearby.</li>
            <li>A significantly reduced risk of car-jacking.</li>
            <li>An easy way of finding a lost vehicle - using our tracking services.</li>
            <li> Car monitoring even in remote locations - even when Wifi and Bluetooth fail.</li>
        </ol>
      

      <div class='separator'>Why we will be chosen over the competition</div>

      Here's how we stand out from the competition:

      <ul>
          <li>The cost of the CarProtect device is only about $20. On the other hand, LoJack costs $700-$1000. This makes LoJack unreliable for people using rented or used cars. A single Apple AirTag costs $30. Dash cams cost $100-$500. BMW's security system costs more than $550. </li>
          <li>We provide real-time GPS tracking. This doesn't work very effectively in LoJack (as the tracking isn't real time) and Apple AirTags only give updated information when an iPhone is nearby.</li>
          <li>Convenience and easy-to-setup: most car security systems require hours of installation, with an additional $100 cost. With our system, all you need to do after buying the product is to scan our QR code (to identify it) and attach it to your car using its safe adhesive.</li>
          <li>Long-lasting: CarProtect avoids the annoyance of draining your car's battery.</li>
      </ul>


      <div class='separator'>Our KVP statement</div>

        <p>Our <b>car security/monitoring system and app</b> helps <b>tourists as well as people who rent cars</b> who want <b>to prevent thieves from breaking into their cars and stealing valuable items</b> by <b>notifying the user of a break-in</b> and <b>deterring the thief by recording their footage</b> unlike <b>LoJack, Apple AirTags, the Dashcam, and BMW's security system.</b> </p>
