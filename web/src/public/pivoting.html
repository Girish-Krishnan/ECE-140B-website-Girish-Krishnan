      <p>This section describes the history of our product pivots, the pivots we plan on doing now, along with any potential future pivots we may have in store. For each pivot, I will identify which of the 10 pivot strategies apply, giving an explanation for each of them.</p>

      <div class='separator'>Pivots we have already made</div>

      <h2 class="bordered">Changing the entire theme of security - from solving package theft to car theft</h2>

      <p>Our initial idea for our ECE 140B project was to work on a system that would detect and prevent package theft, i.e. porch pirates who steal packages from your doorstep. However, it was difficult to gauge actual customer need for such a system. After discussing this with Rick in his office hours, I decided to change the focus of the business to car security, which, according to our customer surveys, was a more relevant and pressing issue among customers than package theft.</p>

      <p>
    <br>
      <b>Which pivot strategy applies here?: A customer need pivot</b>
      <br>

      <b>Why?</b>
      <br>
      <p>A customer need pivot begins with dissatisfied customers. We conducted surveys online for the initial idea (package theft) but found that very few (if any) potential customers would be happy to buy a system that prevents package theft, given the fact that security cameras for homes already exist. Furthermore, it was difficult to explain the concept of a package theft prevention system (a mouthful to say). Instead, a car security system to stop break-ins was much more intuitive to customers and a lot of prospective customers were interested in trying it.</p>
      </p>

      <h2 class="bordered">Narrowing the focus of the device to just break-in detection and surveillance</h2>
      <p>We decided to jettison the use of an accelerometer (to determine tilt/orientation of the car) and focus more on aspects such as vibration detection (if someone breaks in or if the car is hit), location tracking, and viewing the car remotely. This would make the initial cost of the device reasonable to the customer without removing too much functionality.</p>
      <p>
    <br>
      <b>Which pivot strategy applies here? : Zoom-in Pivot</b>
      <br>

      <b>Why?</b>
      <br>
      <p>This is clearly a zoom-in pivot because we removed any unnecessary or insignificant features and focused deeper on a smaller subset of features. This allowed us to ensure that the vibration detection and the live video streaming were perfect and clear to the customer, without being compromised by other unnecessary features.</p>
      </p>


      <div class='separator'>Pivots we plan on doing now</div>

      <p>Here are the pivots we plan on doing now.</p>

      <h2 class="bordered">Broadening the range of customers - from just car users to any vehicle users (and rebranding our company name too!)</h2>

      <p>Although we have completed making the CarProtect MVP device for ECE 140B, we found that the device is also potentially useful for other vehicles, especially bikes and scooters. In fact, a lot of our interviewed prospective customers mentioned that it would be useful to find a way to prevent scooter theft. Broadening the range of vehicles that could use CarProtect is important for future scalability. Since the name "CarProtect" is restricted to just cars, we may change the name to something cooler and more universal for other vehicles too.</p>

      <p>
    <br>
      <b>Which pivot strategy applies here? : Zoom-out pivot</b>
      <br>

      <b>Why?</b>
      <br>
      <p>Clearly, we're zooming out to a larger vision of creating accessible security to a wider range of vehicles - not just cars. Our product may also extend to aspects such as safety monitoring in vehicles (from bicycles to rollercoaster rides) and we hope to make the possibilities endless</p>
      </p>

      <h2 class="bordered">Changing our intended target customer to the owners of car rental companies</h2>

      <p>Car rentals have special interest in CarProtect since it helps them monitor the quality of the cars they own and find who is responsible for any damage or theft from the rented cars. Furthermore, car rentals could buy CarProtect in bulk and install it in all their cars, getting remote access to each of them.</p>

      <p>
    <br>
      <b>Which pivot strategy applies here? : Customer segment pivot</b>
      <br>

      <b>Why?</b>
      <br>
      <p>Our product does draw customers, but more interest seems to appear from the car rental market than from car owners in general, because low-cost rented cars typically have poor security systems in them. </p>
      </p>


      <div class='separator'>Pivots that would be necessary going forward</div>

      <h2 class="bordered">Changing our revenue model to allow for flexible pricing - either subscription-based or one-time.</h2>

<p>We will give customers the option to either opt for subscription-based pricing (i.e. they use CarProtect temporarily, for e.g. when they're a tourist going on a short trip) or a one-time purchase that covers everything. Our customer surveys have shown that some customers prefer the one-time purchase while others want it subscription-based. Giving this flexible option will ensure we can draw a wider range of customers who have different preferences.</p>

      <p>
    <br>
      <b>Which pivot strategy applies here?: Value Capture Pivot</b>
      <br>

      <b>Why?</b>
      <br>
      <p>We are planning to change our revenue model to capture a good market segment - it can be difficult to determine which model works best for customers without actually launching our product, but a flexible pricing model ensures that customers are not drawn away just because of the pricing scheme. Once we gauge the statistics of purchases for each pricing plan, we may again narrow down to one particular pricing model.</p>
      </p>

      <h2 class="bordered">Creating a complete safety and security suite of features</h2>

      <p>We aim to expand CarProtect into a more comprehensive safety and security system that helps prevent damage to cars (and people) during car break-ins and even road accidents. We plan to add a system that would prevent broken glass from hitting people in the car, and perhaps a way of preventing theft and break-ins in the first place.</p>

      <p>
    <br>
      <b>Which pivot strategy applies here? : Platform Pivot</b>
      <br>

      <b>Why?</b>
      <br>
      <p>In the future, we aim to shift the platform to encompass a wider range of user needs. After expanding into a more holistic car safety and security system, we will find different customer segments where our business could potentially scale faster and better in the future.</p>
