      <div class='separator'>Top 5 Features of Product</div>

      <p>Here are the top 5 features of CarProtect, ranked by user need. Each feature will be distinguished from its associated benefit.</p>

      <p>
          <b>Feature #1: A small camera to record footage of any car break-in.</b>
          <br>
          <b>Benefit: Easily see the culprit who breaks into your car, and report them to the police.</b>
          <br>
          <b>Which users/personas will benefit? : </b> Any of the personas who are at risk of car-theft and carjacking will benefit from this.
          Some examples of such personas include tourists who temporarily rent cars to go on road trips. Another example is a user who is short of hearing, and thus cannot hear a car alarm effectively. Video footage will thus help them visually identify a thief. 
          <br>
          <b>Why is this benefit so important to them? :</b>
           Based on all our customer interviews, a lot of potential customers complained about how many thieves get away with stealing items from their car, without being seen or noticed. Thus, it is important that customers get a clear visual picture of the thief, so that the thief can be identified and/or reported to the police.
          <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Feature #2: A vibration detection system that raises an alarm when the car shakes.</b>
        <br>
        <b>Benefit: If your car is hit by anything suspicious, you are immediately notified.</b>
        <br>
        <b>Which users/personas will benefit? : </b> Users who may have particularly delicate cars, and those who have valuable items in their car. Users who are concerned about people/other cars accidentally colliding into their car.
        <br>
        <b>Why is this benefit so important to them? :</b> 
        This would help the customer get immediately notfied when something suspicious occurs to their car, and if their car experiences unusual tremors from a break in.
        <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Feature #3: 3.7V, 2000mAh Lipo battery to power the device; lasts 2-3 days.</b>
        <br>
        <b>Benefit: You don't need to have the device plugged in to your car all the time. </b>
        <br>
        <b>Which users/personas will benefit? :</b>  This would particularly benefit personas who either don't have a charging point in their car, or those who don't want to keep devices plugged into their car (since gas is expensive and plugged in devices rely on energy from gas). Would also help those who don't use their car everyday.
        <br>
        <b>Why is this benefit so important to them? :</b> 
        It is annoying to keep a security device plugged in all the time to a car, when instead one can charge their phone or laptop. Furthermore, manual connection of the security device to the car's internal power is also an issue as it requires manual installation and prevents the device from being transferred between multiple cars.
        <br>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <p>
        <b>Feature #4: An infrared motion sensor used to detect motion of a person nearby.</b>
        <br>
        <b>Benefit: If anyone trespasses by your car, you are immediately notified and the person is recorded.</b>
        <br>
        <b>Which users/personas will benefit? : </b>
        Some personas are deeply concerned about trespassers or stalkers who might scan the car and even try putting an AirTag on the car (for tracking in the future). Moreover, this helps identify a possible thief quickly before any damage occurs. This would help personas whose cars are parked outside on streets, rather than in garages.
        <br>
        <b>Why is this benefit so important to them? :</b>
        This helps prevent theft and damage from happening in the first place, and warns the thief of the fact that they are being watched. The customers also feel a sense of personal security when the device does the monitoring for them, so they don't have to keep leaving their house to regularly check on the car.
        <br>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <p>
        <b>Feature #5: A GPS Tracking service (via SIM card) that helps determine the car's precise location </b>
        <br>
        <b>Benefit: You can always know where your car is. If the car is stolen, you can easily pinpoint the location for the police to find it.</b>
        <br>
        <b>Which users/personas will benefit? : </b>
        The personas that would benefit are a really broad spectrum of customers, but some specific ones include those who allow multiple people to borrow their car (and may find it hard to track down the location of their car), as well as car rental service owners who need to track down a car that is missing.
        <br>
        <b>Why is this benefit so important to them? :</b>
        This helps the customer find a lost car, and track down a thief who may have stolen a car. If the car is used by multiple people, the user can find who has their car and where it is located. This reduces the stress of a lost, missing, or misplaced car.

      <div class='separator'>About Our Project</div>
      <h2 class='bordered'> What is CarProtect? </h2>

      <p> Imagine you've parked your car outside to grab some groceries from the local grocery store. After you come back, you notice that the window of your car trunk has been smashed and all your valuables in the trunk are gone. What do you do? Call the police? Most thiefs get away easily without being noticed, especially in large public parking areas. CarProtect will help you deter such thiefs. Our sensors precisely detect when a person attempts to break in, and loud alarms start blaring when a thief attempts to play their game. The premium version of CarProtect provides live video footage, allowing any suspect to be easily identified! </p>
      
      <h2 class='bordered'> How does it work? </h2>

      <p>CarProtect uses a Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR Sensor) to detect the presence of a nearby human being, as well as accelerometers and gyroscopes to detect any suspicious movements around and within the car. Our unmatched glass-break detectors can precisely capture a break-in and notify the police immediately. CarDetect is interfaced with your mobile phone so that you receive live updates through our mobile application. For our premium version, you can also record live video footage of the area near your car trunk and receive a clear picture of any thief.</p>

      <h2 class='bordered'> Customer Discovery </h2>

      <p>The founders of CarProtect know several people who have experienced theft of valuable items from their cars. Although it is possible to retrieve lost items by using location markers such as AirTags, such tracking is inefficient especially when the thief is hundreds of miles away. GPS tracking is also ineffective as it doesn't give a very precise location of a stolen valuable. Why suffer the stress of finding a stolen object, when you can use CarProtect to prevent theft in the first place? The majority of our interviewed prospective customers have told us that they have NEVER gotten any of their stolen items back. Why? This is because the thief was unknown and unrecognizable. Furthermore, the theft came as an unexpected surprise. Our interviewed customers wholeheartedly agreed that CarProtect will identify risks of theft and even deter potential thiefs at a MUCH FASTER RATE than any conventional police investigation.</p>

      <h2 class='bordered'> Competition </h2>

      <p> Our primary competitors are LoJack and Apple AirTags. Even though LoJack uses GPS tracking to find the location of a stolen car, it's important to note that LoJack costs $700-$1000!! On the other hand, CarProtect only costs about $100 and provides real-time detection of possible break-ins, video footage, AND location tracking. And CarProtect is much cheaper! CarProtect is also more effective than AirTags because we use an alarm system to actually prevent theifs. This eliminates the need to find the location of stolen objects, defeating the purpose of AirTags.</p>

      <h2 class='bordered'> Financials </h2>

      <p>We have a Business-to-Customer model that obtains its revenue from direct sales of the IoT device to customers. Our estimated total cost of making one unit (i.e. one CarProtect device) is about $70, considering equipment, manufacturing, and installation. Since we are selling the product for $100, we have a profit margin of $30 per unit. We also earn revenue through sales of the premium model, wherein a camera is used to capture live footage.</p>

      <h2 class='bordered'> Ethics </h2>

      <p>Regarding the use of live recorded media: the video files remain within the IoT device and are not transmitted to the application or across the web. Files not used for evidence purposes (i.e. when a burglary occurs) are deleted automatically within the device. Concerning the possibility of false positives: a false positive is unlikely because we have multiple sensors used to detect a break-in, and if the system indicates a potential risk, then a live video recording is immediately started.</p>
