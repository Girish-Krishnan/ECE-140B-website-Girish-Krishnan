      <div class='separator'>About CarProtect</div>
      <h2 class='bordered'> Who is it for? </h2>

        <p> CarProtect is for people at risk of car break-ins and potential theft of valuable items in their car, such as electronic devices, jewellery, money, and drugs. Our targeted audience includes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Tourists who go out on road trips, typically using rented vehicles (such as jeeps)  - they are at risk of theft especially when they're unfamiliar with the place they're travelling to.</li>
            <li>People who rent cars on a regular basis - especially college students who may not want to purchase a car straightaway (and only need a car for a limited period of time).</li>
            <li>People who purchase used cars - most of which lack sufficient security systems to detect burglaries (and many security systems are too expensive)</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class='bordered'> What does CarProtect do? </h2>

        <p> CarProtect is a small device that's smaller than a smartphone - but powerful enough to detect and deter any potential car-jacker. Once you buy CarProtect, all you need to do is scan its QR code (so that you can monitor it via our free CarProtect App) and fasten the device to the car using its adhesive. When any car burglar tries to break into your car by breaking a window or lifting the car, the installed CarProtect automatically blares a siren and notifies you through the CarProtect app. Furthermore, we have a premium version of the CarProtect device which incorporates a camera and allows you to take a picture of the intruder.  </p>

        <p> In addition, CarProtect provides you real-time GPS tracking of your vehicle, so that you can precisely pinpoint its location.</p>

        <h2 class='bordered'> How does CarProtect work?</h2>

        Here's how CarProtect works:
        <ol>
            <li> Several sensors are used to detect the presence of an intruder, as well as signs of the car being broken into (further details on the sensors are not shown for confidential reasons).</li>
            <li> If a potential intruder arrives, the CarProtect system activates and gives a warning indication to the intruder if they step reasonably close to the car.</li>
            <li> If the car is ultimately broken into, a loud siren buzzes, a picture of the intruder is taken, and the owner is immediately notified with all the data.</li>
            <li> This data can be presented to the police for easier investigation.</li>
            <li> If the car is ever stolen, the system continually records the location of the car in real-time, and the owner is updated with this information.</li>
            <li> The battery for CarProtect is rechargable, and lasts about 3 months.</li>
        </ol>    


      <h2 class='bordered'> What are the key benefits? </h2>

        <p> The key benefits of CarProtect are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Super easy installation - no need to worry about the long and annoying process of installation (that occurs with most modern car security systems)</li>
            <li>Only $20 - much cheaper than existing security systems such as LoJack ($700-$1000!)</li>
            <li>Useful for car rentals, as the device can easily be transferred between vehicles.</li>
            <li>Provides real-time GPS tracking - even when WiFi and Bluetooth fail.</li>
            <li>Easy to use - the low learning curve makes the device convenient and accessible.</li>
        </ol>
