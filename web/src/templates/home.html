      <div class='separator'>User Interface (Assignment 4)</div>

      <h2 class='bordered'> Low-Resolution Mock-Up of our User Interface </h2>

      <p>We already have created a basic webpage mockup of our user interface, and this can be found at http://164.92.89.132/.
      Our website has a basic login page, where the users login to their specific CarProtect device. We do not need a registration page because the login details are provided to the user when the user buys the device.

      Here is what the CarProtect team currrently thinks of our user interface.

      Here is a basic layout of the app, which helps determine possible threats to the car.</p>

      <img src="ui1.png" class="img-responsive">

      <p>Here is what our location tracking interface will look like:</p>

      <img src="ui2.png" class="img-responsive">

      <p>Here is what the live video footage will look like. We will use a camera to capture the video footage.</p>

      <img src="ui3.png" class="img-responsive">

      <p>The image below shows the approximate dimensions of the device.</p>

      <img src="ui4.png" class="img-responsive">


      <h2 class='bordered'> Laws of UI Design </h2>
      
      <p>Here are some examples of the laws of UI design, along with a short description and a corresponding image.</p>

      <h3>Hick's Law</h3>

      <p>Decision making time increases with number/complexity of options. An good UI example of Hick's Law is Gradescope, a tool used by institutions to manage student assignments and post grades. The login page is simple and just requires a username and password. Once the user is logged in, the buttons on the webpage are well-laid out to let the user navigate to their desired course. There are only a few options at each stage, making assignment submission and grading very easy.</p>

      <img src="gradescope_ui.png" class="img-responsive">

      <p>Each section of Gradescope presents only a few options for the user, making decision making time very low.</p>


      <h3>Miller's Law</h3>

      <p>The average person can only keep 7 (+/-) 2 items in working memory. An example that violates this law is Xilinx Vivado. The menus in Vivado have a great range of customizable options, but it is really difficult for one to remember where each option is located. A lot of great features are just cluttered together in a pretty unintuitive way. I'm a TA in a class that uses Vivado and I myself find it difficult to use Vivado!</p>

      <img src="vivado_ui.jpg" class="img-responsive">

      <h3>Tesler's Law</h3>

       <p>There's always a certain amount of complexity that can't be reduced. An example of this is the UCSD COVID test kit vending machines. The machines have a very efficient interface and the vending process is nearly flawless. However, the user needs to swipe their UCSD ID and type in their UCSD username and password to get a testing kit. This can be a little inconvenient, but is the only way to ensure security (and this security feature can't be automated)</p>

      <div class='separator'>Improving Product User Experience</div>

      <p>Firstly, in my initial website, I noticed that the layout of text was a little messy, as text in tables tended to overlap with adjacent cells on small screens. This made it difficult for the user to access the email IDs of my team members for contact. The dimension of VISCOSITY inspired me to edit the styling of the table in my website so that text wraps around, instead of overlapping with other text. This was achieved in CSS by adding the break words feature to allow a long word to be split across two lines (similar to how it's done in a book). Secondly, I used the idea of VISIBILITY to make my text more readable on the website - this was done by ensuring that the background color (light aqua blue) well-contrasted with the color of the text (black). I also aligned the text in ordered and unordered lists so that the text lines up with each bullet point and appears more naturally organized to the reader. I added double-spacing to ensure that too much text isn't squished together. Thirdly, I used the dimension of CONSISTENCY to ensure that each segment of the website is designed in nearly the same manner, so that the user is used to the basic layout and flow of the website, making it easier for them to navigate to different parts. I achieved this by using a centered capitalized header before each section, with subheadings present in interactive boxes that change color when moused over.</p>

      <div class='separator'>About Our Project</div>
      <h2 class='bordered'> What is CarProtect? </h2>

      <p> Imagine you've parked your car outside to grab some groceries from the local grocery store. After you come back, you notice that the window of your car trunk has been smashed and all your valuables in the trunk are gone. What do you do? Call the police? Most thiefs get away easily without being noticed, especially in large public parking areas. CarProtect will help you deter such thiefs. Our sensors precisely detect when a person attempts to break in, and loud alarms start blaring when a thief attempts to play their game. The premium version of CarProtect provides live video footage, allowing any suspect to be easily identified! </p>
      
      <h2 class='bordered'> How does it work? </h2>

      <p>CarProtect uses a Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR Sensor) to detect the presence of a nearby human being, as well as accelerometers and gyroscopes to detect any suspicious movements around and within the car. Our unmatched glass-break detectors can precisely capture a break-in and notify the police immediately. CarDetect is interfaced with your mobile phone so that you receive live updates through our mobile application. For our premium version, you can also record live video footage of the area near your car trunk and receive a clear picture of any thief.</p>

      <h2 class='bordered'> Customer Discovery </h2>

      <p>The founders of CarProtect know several people who have experienced theft of valuable items from their cars. Although it is possible to retrieve lost items by using location markers such as AirTags, such tracking is inefficient especially when the thief is hundreds of miles away. GPS tracking is also ineffective as it doesn't give a very precise location of a stolen valuable. Why suffer the stress of finding a stolen object, when you can use CarProtect to prevent theft in the first place? The majority of our interviewed prospective customers have told us that they have NEVER gotten any of their stolen items back. Why? This is because the thief was unknown and unrecognizable. Furthermore, the theft came as an unexpected surprise. Our interviewed customers wholeheartedly agreed that CarProtect will identify risks of theft and even deter potential thiefs at a MUCH FASTER RATE than any conventional police investigation.</p>

      <h2 class='bordered'> Competition </h2>

      <p> Our primary competitors are LoJack and Apple AirTags. Even though LoJack uses GPS tracking to find the location of a stolen car, it's important to note that LoJack costs $700-$1000!! On the other hand, CarProtect only costs about $100 and provides real-time detection of possible break-ins, video footage, AND location tracking. And CarProtect is much cheaper! CarProtect is also more effective than AirTags because we use an alarm system to actually prevent theifs. This eliminates the need to find the location of stolen objects, defeating the purpose of AirTags.</p>

      <h2 class='bordered'> Financials </h2>

      <p>We have a Business-to-Customer model that obtains its revenue from direct sales of the IoT device to customers. Our estimated total cost of making one unit (i.e. one CarProtect device) is about $70, considering equipment, manufacturing, and installation. Since we are selling the product for $100, we have a profit margin of $30 per unit. We also earn revenue through sales of the premium model, wherein a camera is used to capture live footage.</p>

      <h2 class='bordered'> Ethics </h2>

      <p>Regarding the use of live recorded media: the video files remain within the IoT device and are not transmitted to the application or across the web. Files not used for evidence purposes (i.e. when a burglary occurs) are deleted automatically within the device. Concerning the possibility of false positives: a false positive is unlikely because we have multiple sensors used to detect a break-in, and if the system indicates a potential risk, then a live video recording is immediately started.</p>
